= webfaces-demo

Demo app for using the https://github.com/kito99/webfaces[webfaces^] library.

To build this app, you must have https://nodejs.org[Node^] and https://maven.apache.org/[Maven^] installed.
You can deploy the application on any standard Java servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat.

== Building

This app depends on the webfaces.jar file, which isn't yet in a maven central repository. So, the first step is to checkout
the webfaces repo and build it. See the https://github.com/kito99/webfaces[README^] for details.

After you have installed Node, Maven, and webfaces, you can build the app. Follow these steps from the root folder:

* Run `npm install`
* Run `bower install`
* Run `mvn clean package`

The resulting WAR file should be in the `target` folder.

== Running

Copy the WAR file to the deploy folder of any Java servlet container (Tomcat, WildFly, etc.). You can then access it
 like so:

----
http://localhost:8080/webfaces-demo-0.1-SNAPSHOT/index.jsf?message=foo
----

(Your port and WAR path may be different.)
